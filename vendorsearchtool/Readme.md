1 - Make sure you have Java 11 installed to check it 
Run a CMD and run 'java -version' If it runs fine and give you a version of 11 then its fine
2 - Make sure you latest version of chrome installed
3 - Extract the vendorsearchtool.rar somewhere you are comfortable and open a CMD in that folder and run 'startscrapper.bat'
4 - 'Search' Will only get the data from database you need to do the remote search for the first time
5 - Remote Search Will get the data from browser but you need to login to the broswers first
	1 - Click LoginToBrowser after selecting the option from dropdown i.e. Select 'all' to login to all websites
	NOTE: SparX and Stens websites sometimes gives issues in logging in so you have to make sure the sites are logged in i.e. try manually logging in in the broswer opened by the bot
6 - You can select from which website it should get the data in the dropdown, Select 'All' to get data from everywhere 
7 - 'View More' will give you some additional data from the website
8 - 'Refersh' will get the new data from the website and update it in the database


NOTES: 
	1 - DO NOT CLOSE the broswer windows opened by bot.
	2 - Website 'US Sparx' using google captcha which is specifically designed to restrict bots like this to get into them so there might be some issues some times to get the data 
		after login
	3 - Some websites fails on session managment i.e. Stens.com it fails to log me in even I'm normally browsing in so there might be chances it will give you the exact issue for the bot
	4 - I can open browsers in headless mode i.e. No browser window will open when we click 'Remote Search' but 8/10 websites needs to have a browser insteraction in order to give 
		the data so that's why I kept it open, if you want I can always change it to headless mode
	5 - DO NOT DELETE 'database' folder from the root of the directory
